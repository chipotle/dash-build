This is a zsh script for generating [Dash][] docsets for RethinkDB. It creates
three docsets -- JavaScript, Python and Ruby. The docsets will be created in
a `build` directory directly under the `_dash` directory.

The script requires [pandoc][] for processing, which can be installed from
most package managers including Homebrew.
